# Student Database Project
This code was written in Visual Studio for COP3530 Spring 2019 at Florida Polytechnic University by myself.
Everything here was written in C++, then compiled using make files in a g++ Ubuntu Environment.

# Make Commands
` make clean ` Cleans all of the .o files from the /tests/ directory of the project.

` make test ` Creates a tester executable for each [objectName]Tester.cpp file

` make ` Creates an executable in /src/ for the full implementation of the project
